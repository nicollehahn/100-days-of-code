# 100 Days Of Code - Nikki's Log


### Day 1: February 11, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress:** I have resumed FCC Javascript section.  It has been awhile so I decided to start from the beginning of the Js section.

**Thoughts:** So happy Tribute page is over.  I am so comfortable coding regularly that to use Bootstrap was difficult for me.  I have never really done much w/Bootstrap.

### Day 2:  February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning Javascript on FCC. In addition, I'm am almost finished with a wordpress site!  First time I've created it with a child theme. 

**Thoughts:** Long learning curve, but I'm much more comfortable with Javascript now.  Props go to WP forums, CSS Tricks and those who share how they've solved their problems.  Goes to show how important it is to keep a blog or log of what steps are taken to achieve something.  It really does help those of us who are seeking solutions.
