# 100 Days Of Code - Nikki's Log


### Day 1: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I have resumed FCC Javascript section.  It has been awhile so I decided to start from the beginning of the Js section.

**Thoughts:** So happy Tribute page is over.  I am so comfortable coding regularly that to use Bootstrap was difficult for me.  I have never really done much w/Bootstrap.
